# Cricket Score Keeper
## Second of the Scholarship Challenge Projects


### Features
The **Cricket Score Keeper** aka Court Counter App is a simple, single screen app that lets you track a Cricket Match score... well, given that the match ends after *2 overs* or after *3 wickets* fall.

The app features a switch that switches between which team bats first. The app's logic determines the winner.

All that a user needs to do is press the buttons, which are ergonomically placed - *sort of*.
